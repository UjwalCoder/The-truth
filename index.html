        <br>

 Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist theories. He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”).<br>
 <br>
 In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of Indian writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a silent march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of India Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.<br>
<br>
 <h2>Chandra Shekhar Azad</h2> <br>
 <br>
 <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3fuZUMYhv6Y/TkKx-M2FzzI/AAAAAAAAI7w/vi_oTn7j1Gg/s1600/Chandrashekhar_Azad.jpg" alt="bg image" width="400px" height="600px"> <br> Chandrasekhar Azad, original name Chandrasekhar Tiwari, Chandrasekhar also spelled Chandrashekhar or Chandra Shekhar, (born July 23, 1906, Bhabra, India—died February 27, 1931, Allahabad), Indian revolutionary who organized and led a band of militant youth during India’s independence movement.<br>

 Azad was drawn into the Indian national movement at a young age. When apprehended by the police at age 15 while participating in Mohandas K. Gandhi’s noncooperation movement (1920–22) at Banares (now Varanasi), he gave his name as Azad (Urdu: “Free” or “Liberated”) and his address as “prison.” Although because of his age he was not imprisoned, he was given a severe flogging by the police. The Indian National Congress (Congress Party) soon lionized him, and he gained popularity among the Indian people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 
 Azad was disappointed by Gandhi’s suspension of the noncooperation movement in February 1922, after several policemen had been murdered by a revolutionary mob at Chauri Chaura. Joining the radical Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), Azad participated in several violent crimes, notably the Kakori train robbery (1925) and the revenge killing of a British police officer (1928).<br>
 
 Known for his organizational skills, Azad played a key role in reorganizing the HRA as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association after most of the HRA’s members had been killed or imprisoned. His crimes had made him a wanted man, but Azad was able to elude the police and its informants for several years. According to Jawaharlal Nehru’s autobiography, it was during this period of underground existence that Azad met Nehru in early 1931 to enquire whether—under the discussions being held that resulted in the signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in March—the revolutionaries could expect a fair deal leading to their honourable rehabilitation.<br>
 
 Determined never to be captured by police, Azad was constantly on the move. On February 27, 1931, Azad arranged to meet a revolutionary at Allahabad’s Alfred Park (now Azad Park). He was betrayed to the police, who surrounded him as soon as he entered the park. A gun battle ensued, in which two police officers were wounded, and Azad was fatally shot.<br>

 <h2>Veer Savarkar</h2><br>
 <br>
 <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.ovDcnxFdItJdqDgq2831tgAAAA?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="bg image" width="400px" height="600px"> <br> Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, byname Vir or Veer, (born May 28, 1883, Bhagur, India—died February 26, 1966, Bombay [now Mumbai]), Hindu and Indian nationalist and leading figure in the Hindu Mahasabha (“Great Society of Hindus”), a Hindu nationalist organization and political party.<br>

 While a student of law in London (1906–10), Savarkar helped to instruct a group of Indian revolutionaries in methods of sabotage and assassination that associates of his had apparently learned from expatriate Russian revolutionaries in Paris. During this period he wrote The Indian War of Independence, 1857 (1909), in which he took the view that the Indian Mutiny of 1857 was the first expression of Indian mass rebellion against British colonial rule.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 In March 1910 Savarkar was arrested on various charges relating to subversion and incitement to war and was sent to India for trial and convicted. In a second trial he was convicted of his alleged complicity in the assassination of a British district magistrate in India, and, after sentencing, he was transported to the Andaman Islands for detention “for life.” He was brought back to India in 1921 and released from detention in 1924. While imprisoned he wrote Hinditva: Who Is a Hindu? (1923), coining the term Hindutva (“Hinduness”), which sought to define Indian culture as a manifestation of Hindu values; this concept grew to become a major tenet of Hindu nationalist ideology.
 
 Savarkar resided in Ratnagiri, India, until 1937, when he joined the Hindu Mahasabha, which militantly defended the Hindus’ claims of religious and cultural supremacy over Indian Muslims. He served as president of the Mahasabha for seven years. In 1943 he retired to Bombay. When Mohandas K. Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a former member of the Mahasabha, Savarkar was implicated, but he was acquitted in his subsequent trial because of insufficient evidence.

January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan), Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>Early Political Life</h2>
 Early life and political activity
The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.<br>
Bose joined the noncooperation movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who had made the Indian National Congress a powerful nonviolent organization. Bose was advised by Gandhi to work under Chitta Ranjan Das, a politician in Bengal. There Bose became a youth educator, journalist, and commandant of the Bengal Congress volunteers. His activities led to his imprisonment in December 1921. In 1924 he was appointed chief executive officer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, with Das as mayor. Bose was soon after deported to Burma (Myanmar) because he was suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements. Released in 1927, he returned to find Bengal Congress affairs in disarray after the death of Das, and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress. Shortly thereafter he and Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the Indian National Congress. Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of the party against the more compromising, right-wing Gandhian faction.<br>
<br>
His death is mystry till today people say that he passed away in plane crash and his body dint recover in that plane crash his contibution was the most in the struggle of freedom.<br>

<h1>People who are Remembered as Great leaders But they were not</h1>
<h2> Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
<img src="https://thegandhiinspiration.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/cropped-1000509261001_2033463483001_mahatma-gandhi-a-legacy-of-peace.jpg" alt="bg image" width="800px" height="600px"> 
<br>
<br>
Mahatma Gandhi was born on 2nd of October 1869 and he was assassinated on 30th January 1948 people think that he was a graet person but reality is different.<br>
He was from Gujrat and belonged from strict vegitarian family but due to his freinds in College he started eating Non-veg He went for his Higher studies in South Africa where he did LLB over there when he came back he saw the condition of the nation.<br>
He tought that this was a good chance to establish his own power so he called him self as saint after that and he started opposing British empire which was good.<br>
But back of this he was preparing his own plan. Britishers obeyed him what he said always he basicly got the powers what he wanted to do he could do he was having sympathy of people.<br>
<br>
<br>
People saw the original color of Gandhi that day when Shaeed Bhaghat Singh and his mates attacked British Parliment using a Hand made bomb an many people were killed that day in Parliment Bhaghat singh and his mates were areested on the sport they were tried in Court.<br>
British Court sentenced all of them Death. When Gandhi came to know about this attack he was sad. This showed what Gandhi's first priority is Power and politics not the nation. <br>
As Britishers had a soft corner for Gandhi If Gandhi wanted he could save Bhagat singh and his mates from death but he did not do that he kept quiet and after all this Britishers announced date of Fhashi (Date of Hanging).<br>
<br>
<br>
23 March 1931 is the unforgetable date this is the date when the three of them young people were hanged and we lost the young revolutionary blood after this many protests started against Gandhi and Britishers.<br>

<h2>Jawaharlal Nehru</h2>
<img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2018/11/Jawaharlal-Nehru-4.jpg?impolicy=website&width=0&height=0" alt="bg image" widhth="400px" height="600px"><br>
<br>
<br>
Jawaharlal Nehru, byname Pandit (Hindi: “Pundit” or “Teacher”) Nehru, (born November 14, 1889, Allahabad, India—died May 27, 1964, New Delhi), first prime minister of independent India (1947–64), who established parliamentary government and became noted for his neutralist (nonaligned) policies in foreign affairs. He was also one of the principal leaders of India’s independence movement in the 1930s and ’40s.<br>
<br>
<h2>Early Years</h2>
<br>
<br>
Nehru was born to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative aptitude and scholarship, who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a son of Motilal Nehru, a renowned lawyer and leader of the Indian independence movement, who became one of Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s prominent associates. Jawaharlal was the eldest of four children, two of whom were girls. A sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly.<br>
Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and tutors. Only one of those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist, Ferdinand Brooks—appears to have made any impression on him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor who taught him Hindi and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to Harrow, a leading English school, where he stayed for two years. Nehru’s academic career was in no way outstanding. From Harrow he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an honours degree in natural science. On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a barrister after two years at the Inner Temple, London, where in his own words he passed his examinations “with neither glory nor ignominy.”<br>
The seven years Nehru spent in England left him in a hazy half-world, at home neither in England nor in India. Some years later he wrote, “I have become a queer mixture of East and West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.” He went back to India to discover India. The contending pulls and pressures that his experience abroad were to exert on his personality were never completely resolve<br>
<br>
<br>
Because of him during war of India and China in year 1965 India lost the war because of him and we lost a large amount of land because of him he gave the slogan( Hindu Chinni Bhai Bhai ) China took a grat advantage of this and went against us.<br>
<br>
After we got Independence in year 1947 after 6 months of Independence Pakistan started war against us and we almost won the war but Jawarlal Nehru he gave the oders to come back and we lost almost 30% percent of land.<br>
<br>
<br>
According to me ( Ujwal Kumar Rao) There were many Leaders who sacrificed their lifes but we dont know about them but people who just fought for their Selfishness we know all about them we should know the reality and respect them who actually contributed their lifes<br>
